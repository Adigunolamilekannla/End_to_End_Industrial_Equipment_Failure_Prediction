# Industrial Equipment Failure Prediction  

## Problem Statement  
Industrial machines are the backbone of manufacturing, energy, and transportation.  
However, unexpected equipment failures lead to:  
- Costly downtime  
- Safety risks for workers  
- Reduced productivity  

Traditionally, maintenance is either:  
- **Reactive**: Fixing after failure (too late)  
- **Preventive**: Fixed schedules (may waste resources)  

The solution is **Predictive Maintenance** using **Machine Learning**.  
By analyzing **sensor data** and **environmental conditions**, our model predicts if a machine is about to fail.  

This allows companies to:  
- Take action before breakdowns  
- Reduce costs and downtime  
- Protect assets and workers

## Why It Matters for Business  
- Reduce downtime → Avoid millions in production losses  
- Save maintenance costs → Replace parts only when needed  
- Improve safety → Prevent hazardous breakdowns  
- Boost efficiency → Keep machines running at peak performance

## My ML Solution  
We developed a **machine learning pipeline** that:  
- Collects and preprocesses sensor data  
- Detects anomalies and patterns before failure occurs  
- Trains predictive models Random Forest
- Provides actionable predictions for maintenance teams  

This shifts operations from reactive to predictive maintenance, maximizing ROI.
